The RSA Factoring Challenge is an optional Algorithm Scripting project offered by Julien Barbier. The project is designed to simulate a real-world scenario where an unsecured network has been sniffed, leading to the discovery of numbers used to encrypt important documents. The goal of the project is to factorize these numbers as quickly as possible, before the target fixes the encryption bug on their server.

The project is not mandatory, but completing any part of it will add a project grade of over 100% to the student's average. The project encourages students to have fun while learning about RSA, HTTPS security, prime factorization, and why RSA is important.

The project requires that students choose their preferred programming language and use the Standard Ubuntu 20.04 LTS/ operating system. The project includes a checker that was released on June 22, 2023, and an auto-review will be launched at the deadline, which is July 2, 2023, at 11:00 PM.
